# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2023 ðŸŽ„

This uses [AoC Runner](https://github.com/caderek/aocrunner).

The repo was installed using Node 20, running `npx aocrunner init` and choosing

 - Year: 2023
 - Directory name: TypeScript
 - Language: TypeScript
 - Strict mode: yes
 - Semicolons: no
 - Author: Norbert Kiesel
 - Package manager: NPM
   
I then added `lodash-es` as dev dependency, updated the Node version in
`package.json` to Node 20, and added my session key in `.env`.
